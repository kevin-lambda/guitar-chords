            My goal is to share the enjoyment of musical expression. I made this
            website because I wish this was the framework I learned when I first
            started playing guitar. This is a method for the foundation of a
            musical journey. By approaching in terms of chord quality shapes, it
            does two things. It unlocks all the chords of a quality right away
            and just gets you playing. Then it gets you thinking about chords in
            terms of quality.

          <p className="mt-3">
            Seeing chords presented in this way might get you asking:
          </p>
          <ul className="">
            <li>
              If there's many ways to play the same chord, which should I use?
            </li>
            <li>
              Why do major and minor chord shapes only have one note difference?
            </li>
            <li>
              When do you want to use a major or minor chord, or any of the
              other ones?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3">
            I leave it up to you to explore these questions. Or in the future,
            I'll incorporate these concepts into a tool.
