=====================================
DEV vs PROD reminder:

- prisma/schema.prisma. database url

=====================================
8/22/23
Main topics:

- user auth, public clerk key
- env variables
- db wiping
- cookies
- user input page title
- refactoring... TBD
- project management. sprint, then review and document
- object property using bracket. but instead of using a full variable, using a template literal... so it seems like bracket uses the evaluated variable

misc

- tried map within a map. it works!

  Detailed notes:

- ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR when trying to access localhost fetch http.

  - fix: make sure the fetch url for localhost is `http` and NOT `https`
  - ✔️ `http://localhost:3000`
  - ❌ `https://localhost:3000`

- cleaning up

- how to easily switch between dev and prod db environments
- next run dev.... loads .env.development.local varialbles
- next run start.... loads .env.production.local varialbles
- duh
- process.env.NODE_ENV automatically reads which environment we are in. production or development. maybe test as well?

- for environ variables in vercel, don't use quotes. quotes okay for local env variables

- prisma env(), how does this work? does it know .env from env.development.local?

=====================================
