- functions and when to optimize or modularize. Does the name of the function do just that thing? Or does it do a bunch of other stuff? If a bunch of other stuff, maybe it's time to separate things.
- so.... maybe optimize/modularize when: repeating a bunch of times, or when a block is doing many different intent things at once.

- begin glad/lucky I decided to name data things properly. Not just for understanding when reading it again later. But for connecting/target data to each other.

????
? is there a different when using a state and function. should we be passing in the state as a function argument? Or just access the state directly like normal?

- updated svg render with reduced padding
