// Lessons learned

- scaling, useState
- what schema data type, and where do we want to do the parsing work.
  - schema data s/b in the most clear way to work with. used. array vs string
- state, function, ui
- once scaling up, object sizes become hard to keep all in head, therefore typescript

//////////write up sections

- prisma model basics
- relations
- seed data
  - creating record with related records. include syntax
  - m:m records, make separately, then CONNECT. include syntax

\*\*\* SEEDING & ID: dont seed data with ids. just let prisma take care of it all. otherwise there will be errors when trying to create later
SEEDING: resets and schema syncs the db. REMOVES ALL RECORDS `npx prisma db push --force-reset`

### API cheatsheet

```tsx
export async function PUT(request, { params }) {
  const parseBody = await request.json()
  const parseId = parseInt(params.id)
  const updatedUser = await prisma.user.update({
    where: {
      id: parseId,
    },
    data: parseBody,
  })
  return NextResponse.json(updatedUser)
}
```

BACKEND

- HTTP requests: need to be **await** & **json parsed**. `request.json()`
- MODEL queries: need to be **await**.
- DYNAMIC ROUTES params: need to be **parse int**.
- HTTP RESPONSE: probably be **type json**. `NextResponse.json(data)`

### front end fetch

on event

- prevent default
- response = await fetch(url, {method: "", body: JSON.stringify( object )})
- parseResponse = await response.json()
- setstate as needed

- prisma model
  common types:
- Int
- String
- OtherModel
- Boolean
- DateTime
- ? // optional
- [] // list aka array

common attributes:

- @id
- @unique
- @default()
- @relation(fields:[] , references:[] ) //field = current model value to use, references = other model value to use

common functions:

- autoincrement()
- now()

common patterns:
id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
email String @unique
name String
createdAt DateTime @default(now())
updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
owner User @relation(fields:[ownerId] , references:[id])
ownerId Int

RELATIONS:
1:1 = User{Profile} ; Profile{User @relation(fields:[], references:[])}
1:m = User{Post[]} ; Post{User @relation(fields:[], references:[])}
m:m = Post{Category[]} ; Category{Post[]}

seed data:

- when making seed data, model relations that can have many of a model don't need to define those things. it can have many.
- when making an instance of a model with a field that must have one owner, it must be defined at that time.

so...
// NO NEED define
pages ChordPage[]

// YES NEED define. by giving chordQualityId an Id
chordQuality ChordQuality @relation(fields:[chordQualityId],references:[id])
chordQualityId Int

////////////////
big brain time

- okay theres create read(find) update delete. but these only are the top level actions. such as crud owner details. or crud pet details.

- we know about include. which can return all the things an owner owns.

// ???

- but what about giving an owner an existing pet? >>>> connect, under an update query. data:{model:{connect ARRAYofOBJECTS}}
- or what about creating an owner with new pets at the same time? >>>> create, under a create query. data:{model:{create ARRAYofOBJECTS}}.

  - prisma should know to create ids automatically as defined. and
  - prisma should know that the nested create will belong to that record...

- probably for what we're trying to do here. it is best to create the model records separately, then connect. because we'd be trying to track down ids and stuff.

admin UI

7/18
needing to adjust schema after starting to implement things.

- quality formula was array of strings, so it would be easier to work with later.
  ["1", "3", "5"],
  - but to create it via UI, would need to have a bunch of inputs for separate element. input 1 ; input 3 ; input 5
  - ACTUALLY, can just input it as a string, but with spaces. 1 3 5. then parse it on the frontend into an array of strings, which would save into db.
    !

problem: SCALING
desc: having a bunch of object properties to create. many inputs. dont want to make a setstate for each one. so trying to handle all inputs on one setstate
handleing multiple inputs on one setstate

- learning about spread operator object with setstate. started writing it out,

- spread syntax. {...obj1, ...obj2} will spread out the properties of both objects, then combine to one object.
  This can work with single properties too. { ...obj1, prop9: "value"}

  // e.target.name is from the input, and MATCHES an existing property in the object. name must exactly match the obj property
  // then as the onchange happens, we get a new value. e.target.value

  // onchange we set a new state, this state is the previous state in spread syntax.
  // BUT with a new property. In this case e.target.name matches an existing property and will overwrite the old prop value

  // so we update just that state

  // key things: name property in input, controlled input component with value prop, onChange handler with spread and additional syntax
